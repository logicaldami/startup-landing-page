# Startup Landing Page
Startup Landing Page is a project that showcases how a simple landing page is built; standing in as a practice assessment from the ZeroToMastery's [ZTM] Product Design Course (Complete Web & Mobile Designer: UI/UX, Figma, + more by Andrei Neagoie & Daniel Schifano) on Udemy. I placed it on Github so I could follow up closely on completing the assessment as a means to improve my Product Design to Developer skill.
